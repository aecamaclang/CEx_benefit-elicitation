Still they have persisted this long so I think that they will likely continue. Active management likely improves the overall outlook but as these systems are more complicated than expected, failure or reduction in habitat quality is always a possibility (Such as loss of heterogeneity). I feel as this active management is limited and mostly just excluding people I think it has a higher probability of success than more involved activities.  If refering to pike, I think they are likely fine."
