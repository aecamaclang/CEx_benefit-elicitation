4,"Bull Trout","LOWEST","25","50","8","The sediment damage has been ongoing for decades, and the population remains relatively abundant. This suggests the damage is more of a ""potential loss in the future"" than a current serious loss. It is a issue of probabilities in the future; will a tipping point of too much sediment be reached with, or without the restoration? This project reduces the threat of sediment causing a population loss, but does not ensure the persistence of the Bull Trout. It is a wise and necessary action, AS A PROBABILITY to improve persistence of Bull Trout."

The COSEWIC Status Assessment Report presents the consensus of expert opinion from the COSEWIC Arthropod Species Subcommittee, that within Canada the relative abundance of the Transverse Lady Beetle has been significantly reduced compared to historical levels and extent. The Transverse Lady Beetle has continued to decline or is managing to persist in low numbers across the majority of its range (including AB), while the species appears common and somewhat isolated from the impact of non-native species in BC, YT, NT and likely NU. (COSEWIC 2017)"

9,"Western Bumble Bee","LOWEST","B","B","4","habitat generalist, found in a wide variety of open habitats, including montane/ lower elev meadows within open coniferous, deciduous, and mixed-wood forests and woodlands; riparian areas; roadsides (COSEWIC 2014; Williams et al. 2014; BC CDC 2021); habitat may be provided by the project area but unknown if the SAR would be found in project area. Maybe some very marginal benefit with project location in foothills so at distance from areas where insecticide use, commercial non-native bee rearing would be presumed to be a greater stressor, but would want to have documentation of SAR invertebrates (bees, lady beetles) at site."

9,"Porsild's Bryum","LOWEST",NA,NA,"4","Specific known locations named in the Recovery Strategy appear to be upstream of the area of the project. The following combination of biophysical habitat attributes is required to support a colony of Porsild’s Bryum: Calcareous cliffs or rock outcrops; Continuous or intermittent seepage; Shaded rock face; shade maintained by size and aspect of cliff face, or a continuous tree cover;  A microenvironment characterised by lower temperatures and higher relative humidity than adjacent habitat where the species is absent (Recovery Strategy for the Porsild’s Bryum 2017).  
Activities likely to result in destruction of critical habitat include alteration to hydrology or water quality/chemistry owing to human landscape use, rock and soil disturbance, deposition of road dust on moss or adjacent vegetation. Effects of these activities can include reduction in relative humidity, reduction in water flow (drought), or increases in site temperature (loss of adjacent canopy, change in shading) and these can alter biophyscial attributes supporting species persistence."
