4,"The ""intended outcomes"" are fairly easily achieved, assuming illegal OHV activity can be curtailed. And also assuming additional ladscape alterations (forestry, road building) do not add to the problems. However, the ""intended outcomes"" are further assumed to benefit Bull Trout. That might not be as plausible. Several other factors affect Bull Trout persistence, especially illegal harvest and harm to the other parts of the Mackenzie Creek fishes' range. It is also important to note that no other fish species forms a population in Mackenzie Creek. It is a Bull Trout monoculture.",NA

6,"Assumed that the OHV exclusion fully worked in the highest plausible probability and that ALL restoration activities fully changed the function and grew/stayed in place as intended and rapid recovery then took place in the soil & plant community.  In the lowest success, assumed that there were some small incursions of OHVs but that mostly they were still all excluded successfully, but that the restoration itself didn't 'take' as well--might get washed out by floods, or drought conditions result in poor and slow growth of woody plants to colonize and successfully grow along banks and trails and that decompaction wasn't deep enough so soil's water holding capacity and ability to regrow plants was reduced from ideal.  The best success assumed that all OHV exclusion was 100% successful and that the restoration actions to decompact, reduce sediment and plant new woody plants were quite successful but not all grew (which is realistic) and also that delays in regrowth to fill in the spaces mean that the 'best' restoration isn't possible if it all doesn't magically grow & sprout to max possible in year 1 (which it inevitably won't).",NA

7,"Assuming that creek restoration moves forward and all OHV trail access is restricted (with enforcement), there is a good probability that the project will be a success. Knowing that OHV operators may not always follow rules (the reason for the creek degredation issue in the first place), there is a chance that the restoration will have a reduced outcome or fail without proper enforcement and monitoring. The impact of restoration on Bull Trout will likely have a positive impact on the species persistence in the area along with other fish and amphibian species. While the presence and abundance of some terrestrial species is potentially limited there, a reduction in OHV use in the project area will likely have a positive impact on the persistence of several terrestrial species with restoration through a reduction in habitat and noise disturbance and sedimentation, which will increase food quality (e.g. emergent aquatic insects, riparian plants) and availability.",NA

9,"I am assuming  100% success depends on achievement of beneficial changes to all components described as the project's intended outcome.  Factors that can influence potential for success in such projects include: the time and resources invested in routine monitoring and maintenance of habitat features and revegetgation areas; timing and duration of monitoring and maintenance during not only an initial period of establishment post-construction but following periods of observations of increased stream discharge, increased watershed disturbance, or increased human use of riparian areas, trails, waterbodies; skill, experience with modifying physical instream structures of those undertaking the project; surrounding area land mangement controls on access and upper watershed conditions.  I have previous personal work experience with constructing and monitoring instream and riparian restoration projects addressing salmonid habitat enhancement and revegetation programs  (10 years) - this informs my estimates of probability of success.",NA
